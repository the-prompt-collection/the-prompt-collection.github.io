## Prompt Engineering Key Terms

### Advanced Prompt Engineering
*   **Definition:** A sophisticated approach to optimizing AI language model performance by refining the input or prompt without modifying the model's weights.
*   **Example:** Using techniques like Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT) or Self Consistency to improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated outputs.

### Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)
*   **Definition:** A technique that improves complex reasoning in language models by presenting examples of human-like reasoning steps, enabling the model to generate intermediate reasoning stages before reaching a final answer.
*   **Example:** Providing a series of interconnected thoughts to guide the model through a problem-solving process, like breaking down a math word problem into logical steps.

### Contextual Priming

*   **Definition:** Providing the AI model with relevant background information and context to shape its understanding of a specific request, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
*   **Example:** Giving the AI information about the target audience, the desired tone, and the specific learning objectives when asking it to generate training content.

### Few-Shot Prompting

*   **Definition:**  A technique where a few examples are provided within the prompt to guide the model toward the desired output, improving its performance on specific tasks.
*   **Example:** Showing the AI a few examples of correctly translated sentences before asking it to translate a new sentence.

### Language Model (LLM)

*   **Definition:**  A type of AI model trained on a vast dataset of text and code, enabling it to understand and generate human-like text in response to prompts.
*   **Example:** ChatGPT is a large language model that can understand and respond to user prompts in a conversational manner.

### Meta Prompting

*   **Definition:** A two-step prompting process where the initial prompt generates a secondary, more specific prompt, refining the input to increase accuracy and improve contextual understanding.
*   **Example:** Using an initial prompt to gather information about the user's needs and then using that information to generate a more tailored and specific prompt for the AI.

### Multi-Step Reasoning

*   **Definition:** Breaking down complex tasks or problems into smaller, sequential steps, allowing the AI to process information and respond more logically and systematically.
*   **Example:** Dividing a complex task like writing a story into smaller steps like brainstorming ideas, creating an outline, writing a draft, and editing.

### Personas

*   **Definition:** A technique in prompt engineering where the AI is instructed to adopt a specific role, voice, or character perspective, enabling it to generate tailored content aligned with the desired tone, style, and expertise.
*   **Example:** Asking the AI to write an email as a customer service representative or to generate a social media post as a brand ambassador.

### Prompt

*   **Definition:** The input provided to a language model, guiding it to generate a specific response.
*   **Example:** A question, a statement, a set of instructions, or any other input that guides the AI's output.

### ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

*   **Definition:**  An advanced prompt engineering technique that combines reasoning steps with action steps, allowing the model to both generate answers and explain the reasoning behind them, improving accuracy and interpretability.
*   **Example:** An AI assistant that can access external websites to gather information and then use that information to answer a question or complete a task.

### Self Consistency

*   **Definition:** A technique where the AI model generates multiple responses to a prompt and then selects the most consistent one, ensuring a more accurate and relevant final output.
*   **Example:** Having the AI generate multiple summaries of a long article and then selecting the summary that best captures the key ideas and is most consistent with the other summaries.

### Zero-Shot Prompt

*   **Definition:** Presenting a task or question to a language model without providing any specific examples or pre-training for that task, assessing its generalizability and ability to handle novel situations.
*   **Example:** Asking an AI to translate a sentence from a language it has never been explicitly trained on.
