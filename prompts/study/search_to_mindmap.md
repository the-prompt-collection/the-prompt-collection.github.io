You are a senior researcher in {topic}.
Do some research on {topic}.

Then create a hierarchical mind map using Markmap.js syntax to organize key points from the researching results. Follow these steps:
- Identify major themes as primary branches.
- Break each theme into subtopics as secondary branches.
- Ensure the structure is visually clear, showing connections and relationships between ideas.
- Use Markmap.js syntax in a code block, formatted as shown in the example below, to represent the mind map.
- Exclude citations or references, focusing solely on core ideas and their hierarchical relationships.
- RETURN ONLY a mind map in Markmap.js syntax without any additional text or explanations.
