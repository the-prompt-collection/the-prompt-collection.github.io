<epic-knowledge>
In Agile software development, an **Epic** is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks (called **user stories**). Epics are typically used to group related work together, often spanning multiple sprints or iterations. They help teams organize and prioritize work while maintaining a high-level view of the project.

### Standard Structure of an Epic
While the exact structure of an epic may vary between organizations, most big companies follow a similar template to ensure clarity and consistency. Below is a commonly used structure for writing an epic:

---

### **1. Title**
- A concise, descriptive name for the epic.
- Example: "User Authentication and Authorization System"

---

### **2. Summary**
- A brief overview of the epic, explaining its purpose and scope.
- Example: "This epic aims to implement a secure user authentication and authorization system to allow users to log in, manage profiles, and access restricted content."

---

### **3. Goals and Objectives**
- Clearly state what the epic is trying to achieve.
- Example:
  - Enable users to register and log in securely.
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types.
  - Ensure compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.

---

### **4. Background and Context**
- Explain why this epic is important and provide any relevant context.
- Example: "Currently, the application lacks a secure authentication system, which is a critical requirement for handling user data and providing personalized experiences."

---

### **5. Scope**
- Define what is included and excluded in the epic.
- Example:
  - **In Scope**: User registration, login, password recovery, and role-based access.
  - **Out of Scope**: Social media login integration (will be handled in a separate epic).

---

### **6. User Stories (or Sub-Tasks)**
- Break the epic into smaller, actionable user stories.
- Example:
  - As a user, I want to register using my email and password so that I can create an account.
  - As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.
  - As an admin, I want to assign roles to users so that I can control access to specific features.

---

### **7. Acceptance Criteria**
- Define the conditions that must be met for the epic to be considered complete.
- Example:
  - Users can successfully register and log in.
  - Passwords are securely hashed and stored.
  - Admins can assign roles to users via a dashboard.

---

### **8. Dependencies**
- List any dependencies that could impact the completion of the epic.
- Example:
  - Dependency on the backend team to implement the authentication API.
  - Dependency on the security team to review and approve the implementation.

---

### **9. Risks and Mitigation**
- Identify potential risks and how they will be addressed.
- Example:
  - Risk: Delays in API development could impact the timeline.
  - Mitigation: Regular sync-ups with the backend team to track progress.

---

### **10. Metrics for Success**
- Define how the success of the epic will be measured.
- Example:
  - 95% of users successfully log in on their first attempt.
  - No security vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing.

---

### **11. Timeline and Milestones**
- Provide a high-level timeline or key milestones for the epic.
- Example:
  - Week 1-2: Complete user registration and login functionality.
  - Week 3-4: Implement password recovery and role-based access.
  - Week 5: Conduct security review and testing.

---

### **12. Stakeholders**
- List the key stakeholders involved in the epic.
- Example:
  - Product Owner: Jane Doe
  - Development Team: Backend and Frontend Teams
  - Security Team: John Smith

---

### **13. Attachments and References**
- Include any relevant documents, wireframes, or links to additional resources.
- Example:
  - Link to the authentication API documentation.
  - Wireframes for the login and registration screens.

---

### **14. Example of a Full Epic Structure

**Title**: User Authentication and Authorization System

**Summary**: This epic aims to implement a secure user authentication and authorization system to allow users to log in, manage profiles, and access restricted content.

**Goals and Objectives**:
- Enable users to register and log in securely.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types.

**Scope**:
- **In Scope**: User registration, login, password recovery, and role-based access.
- **Out of Scope**: Social media login integration (will be handled in a separate epic).

**User Stories**:
1. As a user, I want to register using my email and password so that I can create an account.
2. As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.
