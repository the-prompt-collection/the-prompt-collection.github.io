<story-knowledge>
In Agile software development, a **Story** (or **User Story**) is a concise description of a feature or functionality from the perspective of an end user. The most popular and widely adopted standard for writing user stories follows the **INVEST** criteria and the **"As a... I want... So that..."** template. Below is a detailed explanation of these standards:

---

### **1. The "As a... I want... So that..." Template**
This is the most common and widely used format for writing user stories. It ensures that the story is user-focused and clearly communicates the purpose of the feature.

#### **Structure**:
- **As a** [type of user],
- **I want** [an action or feature],
- **So that** [a benefit or value].

#### **Example**:
- As a **registered user**,
- I want **to reset my password**,
- So that **I can regain access to my account if I forget it**.

---

### **2. INVEST Criteria**
The **INVEST** acronym stands for a set of criteria that ensure user stories are well-defined and effective. These criteria are:

#### **I - Independent**:
- The story should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.
- Example: Avoid writing stories that must be completed in a specific sequence.

#### **N - Negotiable**:
- The story should be flexible and open to discussion. It is not a rigid contract but a starting point for conversation.
- Example: The team can discuss and refine the details during sprint planning.

#### **V - Valuable**:
- The story should deliver value to the end user or the business.
- Example: A story that improves user experience or solves a problem is valuable.

#### **E - Estimable**:
- The story should be clear enough for the team to estimate its effort.
- Example: Avoid vague stories like "Make the app faster" without specific details.

#### **S - Small**:
- The story should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint.
- Example: Break down large stories into smaller, manageable ones.

#### **T - Testable**:
- The story should have clear acceptance criteria so that it can be tested.
- Example: Include specific conditions that define when the story is complete.

### **3. Components of a User Story**
A well-written user story typically includes the following components:

#### **a. Title**:
- A short, descriptive name for the story.
- Example: "Password Reset Functionality"

#### **b. Description**:
- Written in the "As a... I want... So that..." format.
- Example: As a **registered user**, I want **to reset my password**, so that **I can regain access to my account if I forget it**.

#### **c. Acceptance Criteria**:
- A list of conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
- Example:
  - The user receives an email with a password reset link.
  - The link expires after 24 hours.
  - The user can set a new password after clicking the link.

#### **d. Priority**:
- Indicates the importance of the story (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Example: High (critical for user experience).

#### **e. Estimation**:
- The effort required to complete the story, often measured in story points or hours.
- Example: 3 story points.

#### **f. Dependencies**:
- Any other stories or tasks that must be completed before this one.
- Example: Dependency on the email service being set up.

### **4. Example of a Full User Story**

**Title**: Password Reset Functionality

**Description**:
- As a **registered user**,
- I want **to reset my password**,
- So that **I can regain access to my account if I forget it**.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The user can click a "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
2. The user receives an email with a password reset link.
3. The link expires after 24 hours.
4. The user can set a new password after clicking the link.
5. The system validates the new password against security rules.

**Priority**: High

**Estimation**: 3 story points

**Dependencies**:
- Email service must be configured.
- Security rules for passwords must be defined.

### **5. Tools for Writing User Stories**
Many Agile project management tools support the creation and management of user stories. Some popular ones include:
- **Jira**: Widely used for Agile teams, supports epics, stories, and sprints.
- **Trello**: A simple Kanban-based tool for managing stories and tasks.
- **Azure DevOps**: Provides tools for Agile planning, including user stories.
- **OpenProject** and **Taiga**: Open-source alternatives for Agile project management.

---

### **Why Follow These Standards?**
- **Clarity**: Ensures everyone understands the purpose and scope of the story.
- **Focus on Value**: Keeps the team aligned on delivering value to the user.
- **Efficiency**: Helps with planning, estimation, and prioritization.
- **Testability**: Provides clear criteria for testing and validation.

By adhering to these standards, Agile teams can write effective user stories that drive successful software development.
