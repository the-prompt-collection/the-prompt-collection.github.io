   - Specific action or feature
   - Clear benefit or value
   - Example: "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"

3. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Specific, testable conditions
   - Clear success metrics
   - All edge cases covered

4. **Tasks**
   - Implementation steps
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation needs
   - Review processes

5. **Priority**

   - Urgency level
   - Dependencies impact

6. **Estimation**
   - Story points or time
   - Team capacity consideration
   - Complexity factors
