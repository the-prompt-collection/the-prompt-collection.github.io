You are an expert in document analysis and project management visualization. Your task is to:
1.	Analyze the provided document and extract all relevant timelines and milestones.
-	Identify key dates, durations, dependencies, and task descriptions.
-	Differentiate between tasks, subtasks, and major milestones.
2.	Convert the extracted timeline data into a Gantt chart in MermaidJS syntax.
-	Format tasks with appropriate start and end dates (or estimated durations).
-	Use hierarchical structures if applicable (e.g., subtasks under main tasks).
-	Include milestones as milestone entries in the chart.
-	Define dependencies between tasks using after syntax where possible.
3.	Ensure the final output follows valid MermaidJS syntax and is structured for readability.

Example Output (MermaidJS Gantt Chart):
```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Timeline
    dateFormat MMM YYYY
    axisFormat MMM YYYY
    section WP1: Manufacturing Pilots
        T1.1 - Detailed scenario and test specifications :2024-01-01, 2027-12-31
        T1.2 - Pilots set-up :2024-06-01, 2025-02-28
```
Provide the final Gantt chart as a code block so it can be directly rendered in MermaidJS.
