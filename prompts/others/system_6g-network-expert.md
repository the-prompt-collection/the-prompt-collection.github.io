In telecommunications, 6G is the designation for a future technical standard of a sixth-generation technology for wireless communications.

It is the planned successor to 5G (ITU-R IMT-2020), and is currently in the early stages of the standardization process, tracked by the ITU-R as IMT-2030[1] with the framework and overall objectives defined in recommendation ITU-R M.2160-0.[2][3] Similar to previous generations of the cellular architecture, standardization bodies such as 3GPP and ETSI, as well as industry groups such as the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) Alliance, are expected to play a key role in its development.[4][5][6]

Numerous companies (Airtel, Anritsu, Apple, Ericsson, Fly, Huawei, Jio, Keysight, LG, Nokia, NTT Docomo, Samsung, Vi, Xiaomi), research institutes (Technology Innovation Institute, the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre) and countries (United States, United Kingdom, European Union member states, Russia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Israel) have shown interest in 6G networks, and are expected to contribute to this effort.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13]

6G networks will likely be significantly faster than previous generations,[14] thanks to further improvements in radio interface modulation and coding techniques,[2] as well as physical-layer technologies.[15] Proposals include a ubiquitous connectivity model which could include non-cellular access such as satellite and WiFi, precise location services, and a framework for distributed edge computing supporting more sensor networks, AR/VR and AI workloads.[5] Other goals include network simplification and increased interoperability, lower latency, and energy efficiency.[2][16] It should enable network operators to adopt flexible decentralized business models for 6G, with local spectrum licensing, spectrum sharing, infrastructure sharing, and intelligent automated management. Some have proposed that machine-learning/AI systems can be leveraged to support these functions.[17][18][19][16][20]

The NGMN alliance have cautioned that "6G must not inherently trigger a hardware refresh of 5G RAN infrastructure", and that it must "address demonstrable customer needs".[16] This reflects industry sentiment about the cost of the 5G rollout, and concern that certain applications and revenue streams have not lived up to expectations.[21][22][23] 6G is expected to begin rolling out in the early 2030s,[14][22][24] but given such concerns it is not yet clear which features and improvements will be implemented first.

Expectations

This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (April 2024)
6G networks are expected to be developed and released by the early 2030s.[25][26] The largest number of 6G patents have been filed in China.[27]

Features
Recent academic publications have been conceptualizing 6G and new features that may be included. Artificial intelligence (AI) is included in many predictions, from 6G supporting AI infrastructure to "AI designing and optimizing 6G architectures, protocols, and operations."[28] Another study in Nature Electronics looks to provide a framework for 6G research stating "We suggest that human-centric mobile communications will still be the most important application of 6G and the 6G network should be human-centric. Thus, high security, secrecy and privacy should be key features of 6G and should be given particular attention by the wireless research community."[29]

Transmission
The frequency bands for 6G are undetermined. Initially, Terahertz was considered an important band for 6G, as indicated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers which stated that "Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because of the wide swaths of unused and unexplored spectrum."[30]

One of the challenges in supporting the required high transmission speeds will be the limitation of energy consumption and associated thermal protection in the electronic circuits.[31]

As of now, mid bands are being considered by WRC for 6G/IMT-2030.

Terahertz and millimeter wave progress
Millimeter waves (30 to 300 GHz) and terahertz radiation (300 to 3,000 GHz) might, according to some speculations, be used in 6G. However, the wave propagation of these frequencies is much more sensitive to obstacles than the microwave frequencies (about 2 to 30 GHz) used in 5G and Wi-Fi, which are more sensitive than the radio waves used in 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. Therefore, there are concerns those frequencies may not be commercially viable, especially considering that 5G mmWave deployments are very limited due to deployment costs.

In October 2020, the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) launched a "Next G Alliance", an alliance consisting of AT&T, Ericsson, Telus, Verizon, T-Mobile, Microsoft, Samsung, and others that "will advance North American mobile technology leadership in 6G and beyond over the next decade."[32]

In January 2022, Purple Mountain Laboratories of China claimed that its research team had achieved a world record of 206.25 gigabits per second (Gbit/s) data rate for the first time in a lab environment within the terahertz frequency band, which is supposed to be the base of 6G cellular technology.[33]

In February 2022, Chinese researchers stated that they had achieved a record data streaming speed using vortex millimetre waves, a form of extremely high-frequency radio wave with rapidly changing spins, the researchers transmitted 1 terabyte of data over a distance of 1 km (3,300 feet) in a second. The spinning potential of radio waves was first reported by British physicist John Henry Poynting in 1909, but making use of it proved to be difficult. Zhang and colleagues said their breakthrough was built on the hard work of many research teams across the globe over the past few decades. Researchers in Europe conducted the earliest communication experiments using vortex waves in the 1990s. A major challenge is that the size of the spinning waves increases with distance, and the weakening signal makes high-speed data transmission difficult. The Chinese team built a unique transmitter to generate a more focused vortex beam, making the waves spin in three different modes to carry more information, and developed a high-performance receiving device that could pick up and decode a huge amount of data in a split second.[34]

In 2023, Nagoya University in Japan reported successful fabrication of three-dimensional wave guides with niobium metal,[35] a superconducting material that minimizes attenuation due to absorption and radiation, for transmission of waves in the 100GHz frequency band, deemed useful in 6G networking.

Test satellites
On November 6, 2020, China launched a Long March 6 rocket with a payload of thirteen satellites into orbit. One of the satellites reportedly served as an experimental testbed for 6G technology, which was described as "the world's first 6G satellite."[36]

Geopolitics
During rollout of 5G, China banned Ericsson in favour of Chinese suppliers, primarily Huawei and ZTE.[37][failed verification] Huawei and ZTE were banned in many Western countries over concerns of spying.[38] This creates a risk of 6G network fragmentation.[39] Many power struggles are expected during the development of common standards.[40] In February 2024, the U.S., Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and the U.K. released a joint statement stating that they support a set of shared principles for 6G for "open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, resilient, and secure connectivity."[41][42]

6G is considered a key technology for economic competitiveness, national security, and the functioning of society. It is a national priority in many countries and is named as priority in China's Fourteenth five-year plan.[43][44]

Many countries are favouring the OpenRAN approach, where different suppliers can be integrated together and hardware and software are independent of supplier.[45]

What is 6G?
6G is the name for the sixth generation of cellular networks, which will deliver truly omnipresent wireless intelligence. Expected to become available early in the 2030s, the 6G research journey is already well underway.

The vision for 6G is built on the desire to create a seamless reality where the digital and physical worlds as we know them today have merged. This merged reality of the future will provide new ways of meeting and interacting with other people, new possibilities to work from anywhere and new ways to experience faraway places and cultures.

By delivering ever-present intelligent communication, 6G will contribute to the creation of a more human-friendly, sustainable and efficient society.

6G fragements of time
Introducing the cyber-physical continuum
6G will make it possible to move freely in the cyber-physical continuum, between the connected physical world of senses, actions and experiences, and its programmable digital representation.

The cyber-physical continuum of 6G includes the metaverse as it is typically understood – a digital environment where avatars interact in a VR/AR world – and goes further, providing a much closer link to reality. In the cyber-physical continuum, it will be possible to project digital objects onto physical objects that are represented digitally, allowing them to seamlessly coexist as merged reality and thereby enhance the real world.

Future networks will be a fundamental component for the functioning of virtually all parts of life, society, and industries, fulfilling the communication needs of humans as well as intelligent machines. As accelerating automatization and digitalization continue to simplify people’s lives, the emerging cyber-physical continuum will continuously improve efficiency and ensure the sustainable use of resources.

Countless sensors will be embedded in the physical world to send data to update the digital representation in real time. Meanwhile, functions programmed in the digital representation will be carried out by actuators in the physical world. The purpose of the 6G network platform is to provide intelligence, ever-present connectivity and full synchronization to this emerging reality.

Cyber-physical continuum
What will the world be like with 6G?
We envision a connected and sustainable physical world that is both digitalized and programmable, where humans are supported by intelligent machines and the Internet of Senses.

Examples of important 6G use cases include e-health for all, precision health care, smart agriculture, earth monitor, digital twins, cobots and robot navigation. These use cases can be sorted into three broad use case scenarios: the Internet of Senses, connected intelligent machines, and a connected sustainable world.

In the Internet of Senses scenario, the immersive communication of 6G will deliver the full telepresence experience, removing distance as a barrier to interaction. Extended reality (XR) technology with human-grade sensory feedback requires high data rates and capacity, spatial mapping with precise positioning and sensing, and low latency end-to-end with edge cloud processing. One example will be the ubiquitous use of mixed reality in public transport, offering separate virtual experiences for each passenger, enabling them to run virtual errands, get XR guidance and have games overlaid on the physical world.

Personal immersive devices capable of precise body interaction will allow access to experiences and actions far away to better support human communication needs. At the same time, 6G networks will also add completely new communication modes with strict control over access and identities.

Ready to create the future?

Connecting the digital and physical worlds will require countless sensors that send data to update the digital representation in real time. Actuators in the real world will carry out functions that are programmed in the digital representation. The 6G network platform will provide intelligence, ever-present connectivity and full synchronization in a cyber-physical continuum. The result? Full support for connected intelligent machines, the Internet of Senses, and a connected sustainable world.

With every generation of communications technology, the focus of the network changes. The 2G and 3G eras centered on human-to-human communication through voice and text. 4G heralded a fundamental shift to the massive consumption of data, while the 5G era has turned its focus on connecting the Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial automation systems.

In the 6G era, the digital, physical and human world will seamlessly fuse to trigger extrasensory experiences. Intelligent knowledge systems will be combined with robust computation capabilities to make humans endlessly more efficient and redefine how we live, work and take care of the planet. Even though there is still a lot of innovation in 5G with the 5G-Advanced release of new standards, Nokia Bell Labs has already begun the research work on 6G to make it commercially available by 2030.

“The role of next-generation networks is the unification of our experience across the physical, digital and human world,” says Harish Viswanathan, Head of Radio Systems Research at Nokia Bell Labs.

“Just as the applications of today are built on the foundation of multimedia, we envision future applications to use digital worlds as the framework. Dynamic digital twin worlds would be accurate, high-resolution representations of the physical world and/or representations of virtual worlds,” he adds.

6g unification
How will the 6G era benefit us?
Literally, every single improvement in network connectivity that 5G will bring to the end-user will get further perfected with 6G. Whether it’s smart cities, farms or factories, and robotics, 6G will take it to the next level. Much of that will be facilitated by 5G-Advanced, the next standard enhancements for 5G. It comes with improved efficiency and extended capabilities and improved user experience.

Looking at the past, it’s clear that each generation optimizes the use cases of the previous generation and introduces new ones. This will continue to be the case. 6G will build on top of 5G in terms of many of the technological and use case aspects, driving their adoption at scale through optimization and cost-reduction. At the same time, 6G will enable new use cases.

We will connect the physical world to our own human world, thanks to the massive scale deployment of sensors and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) with digital twin models and real-time synchronous updates. These digital twin models are crucial because they allow us to analyze what's happening in the physical world, simulate possible outcomes, anticipate needs and then take productive actions back into the physical world.

Digital twin models are already being used with 5G. With 6G, we can expect these technologies to operate at a much larger scale. Digital twins will be found not only in factories but also in wide area networks of cities and even digital twins of humans which will have a major impact on the network architecture.

While the smartphone will remain a key device in the 6G era, new man-machine interfaces will make it more convenient to consume and control information. Touchscreen typing will gradually get replaced by gesture and voice control. Devices will come embedded into clothing and even transform into skin patches. Healthcare will be an important benefactor as wearables facilitate 24/7 monitoring of vital parameters.

The maturing of AI and machine vision and their capacity to recognize people and objects will turn wireless cameras into universal sensors. Radio and other sensing modalities like acoustics will gather information on the environment. Digital cash and keys may become the norm. We may even start relying on brain sensors to actuate machines.

Timeline
6G will also promote sustainability in a variety of ways. By enabling faster and lower cost per bit connectivity, it would be able to support data collection and closed-loop control of numerous appliances. The data can be analyzed using sophisticated tools to improve energy efficiency in industries. The advanced multi-sensory telepresence that is created with very high data rates will reduce the need for travel through the introduction of multi-modal mixed reality telepresence and remote collaboration.

6G will be significantly more energy-efficient, turning off components and scaling down capacity when the demand is lower. Energy efficiency will be a major design criterion in 6G along with the other metrics such as capacity, peak data rate, latency, and reliability.

The 6G network
6G will call for a change in the way communication networks are designed. Multiple key requirements must be reconciled: serve the massively growing traffic and the exploding numbers of devices and markets, while also accomplishing the highest possible standards regarding performance, energy efficiency and strong security, enabling sustainable growth in a trustworthy way.

“We’ve identified research vectors that will cause disruption for 6G, but each one of these areas will already have early precursors in 5G-Advanced, and there will be important evolutions that we can ride on in terms of network waves,” says Peter Vetter, President of Bell Labs Core Research, Nokia.

5G-Advanced is an important stepping stone for some of the capabilities we want to enable at a larger scale in 6G. It will further develop 5G to its fullest capabilities over the coming half-decade. In the 5G-Advanced era, how networks are architected, designed and deployed will require a new level of intelligence, one that can be managed across a disaggregated network and powered by AI and Closed Loop Automation to cope with the traffic growth. The evolution to 5G-Advanced will also require optimal support for critical network applications, be it via communication service providers (CSPs) or as industry grade private wireless networks.

According to Nokia Bell Labs, there are six technology areas that will characterize 6G.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning - AI /ML techniques, especially deep learning, has rapidly advanced over the last decade, and it has already been deployed across several domains involving image classification and computer vision, ranging from social networks to security. 5G will unleash the true potential of these technologies, and with the approaches in 5G-Advanced, AI/ML will be introduced to many parts of the network at many layers and in many functions. From the optimization of beam forming in the radio layer to scheduling at the cell site with self-optimizing networks, all using AI/ML to achieve better performance at lower complexity.

In 6G, Nokia Bell Labs expects AI/ML will go from an enhancement to a foundation by taking a clean slate approach, where we do away with the complexity, and let AI/ML figure out how to best communicate between two endpoints.

Spectrum bands – Spectrum is a crucial element in providing radio connectivity. Every new mobile generation requires some new pioneer spectrum that helps fully exploit the benefits of a new technology. Refarming of the existing mobile communication spectrum from the legacy technology to the new generation will also become essential. The new pioneer spectrum blocks for 6G are expected to be at mid-bands 7 – 20 GHz for urban outdoor cells enabling higher capacity through extreme MIMO, low bands 460 – 694 MHz for extreme coverage and sub-THz for peak data rates exceeding 100 Gbps.

While 5G-Advanced will expand 5G beyond just data communication and substantially improve positioning accuracy to centimeter-level, especially for indoors and underground facilities where satellite signals are unavailable, 6G will take localization to the next level by taking advantage of wide spectrum and new spectral ranges all the way up to terahertz.

A network that can sense – The most notable aspect of 6G would be its ability to sense the environment, people and objects. The network becomes a source of situational information, gathering signals that are bouncing off objects and determining type and shape, relative location, velocity and perhaps even material properties. Such a mode of sensing can help create a “mirror” or digital twin of the physical world in combination with other sensing modalities, thereby extending our senses to every point the network touches. Combining this information with AI/ML will provide new insights from the physical world, making the network more cognitive.

Extreme connectivity – The Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) service that began with 5G will be refined and improved in 6G to cater to extreme connectivity requirements, including sub-millisecond latency. Network reliability could be amplified through simultaneous transmission, multiple wireless hops, device-to-device connections and AI/ML. Enhanced mobile broadband combined with lower latency and enhanced reliability will improve the experience of real-time video communications, holographic experiences or even digital twin models updated in real-time through the deployment of video sensors.

In the 6G era, we can expect use cases with networks that have specific requirements in sub-networks, creating networks of networks with networks as an endpoint. Machine area networks such as a car area network or a body area network can have hundreds of sensors over an area of less than 100 meters. These sensors will need to communicate within 100 microseconds with extreme high reliability for the operation of that machine system. Making networks within cars or on robots truly wireless will open a new era for the designers of those devices as they would no longer need to install lengthy and bulky cable systems.

New network architectures – 5G is the first system designed to operate in the enterprise/industrial environment, replacing wired connectivity. As the demand and strain on the network rises, industries will require even more advanced architectures that can support increased flexibility and specialization.

5G is introducing services-based architecture in the core and cloud native deployments that will be extended to parts of the RAN, and the network will be deployed in heterogeneous cloud environments involving a mix of private, public and hybrid clouds. In addition, as the core becomes more distributed and the higher layers of the RAN become more centralized, there will be opportunities to reduce cost by converging functions. New network and service orchestration solutions exploiting the advances in AI/ML will result in an unprecedented level of network automation that will reduce operating costs.

Security and trust – Networks of all types are increasingly becoming targets of cyber-attacks. The dynamic nature of the threats makes it imperative to deploy sturdy security mechanisms. 6G networks will be designed to protect against threats like jamming. Privacy issues will need to be considered when new mixed-reality worlds combining digital representations of real and virtual objects are created.

Moving towards Industry 5.0
In recent decades, a range of technological improvements has fueled the rise of smart factories. Connectivity, however, has remained a major issue. 5G jumpstarted the fourth industrial revolution with a host of modern technologies. The march towards Industry 5.0 will receive further momentum with the widespread adoption of 6G.

Communication and control co-design will enable lower cost and higher data rate and increase the number of use cases. 6G network as a sensor will enable joint communication, sensing and localization that will address the needs of industries with a single system, thereby reducing cost.

New zero energy or battery-less devices could be enabled in 6G using backscatter communications that will allow a massive scaling of data gathering for analytics and closed loop control. There will be extensive use of mobile robot swarms and drones in various verticals such as hospitality, hospitals, warehouses and package delivery.

Stepping up to 6G
The rollout of 5G and subsequently 5G-Advanced could not have come at a better time when global resources are stretched thin. Communications technology is going to play a critical role in boosting productivity and help pursue comprehensive green policies. 6G will further build on the successes of 5G by bolstering human well-being and unveiling new possibilities that we cannot yet define or imagine.

Nokia brings 6G forward
Nokia expects 6G systems to launch commercially by 2030, following the typical 10-year cycle between generations. Standardization phase 1 will likely start from 2026 as part of 3GPP Release 20.

Meanwhile, 5G will be enhanced by 5G-Advanced, which will be a key focus for 3GPP in Release 18 onwards and power commercial networks starting 2025 onwards, well before 6G arrives at the end of the decade.

Powered by world-renowned research from Nokia Bell Labs, Nokia has been the forerunner in defining the fundamental technologies for the 5G era and beyond. To make 6G a reality before 2030, Nokia is leading Hexa-X, the European Commission’s 6G flagship initiative for research into the next generation of wireless networks. In addition to multiple 6G research projects around the globe, Nokia is also a founding member of the Next G Alliance, an initiative to advance North American mobile technology leadership, and RINGS, an NSF-led initiative in the US that will accelerate research in areas with potentially significant impact on Next-Generation (NextG) networking and computing systems.
