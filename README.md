# The Prompt Collection

A curated collection of prompts for various creative and practical purposes.

## Categories

* **Writing Prompts:**  Inspire your creative writing with fiction and non-fiction prompts.
* **Interview Questions:** Prepare for job interviews with a range of technical and behavioral questions.

## System Prompts

System prompts (identified with the `system_` in their filename) provide context and persona for the regular prompts. They help you tailor the generated responses to specific scenarios.

## Usage

Each prompt is stored in its own Markdown file containing only the prompt text. You can easily copy and paste these prompts into your preferred writing or AI tool.

## Website

The project website is hosted at [the-prompt-collection.github.io](https://the-prompt-collection.github.io). It allows you to search for prompts by category, subcategory, and description.
